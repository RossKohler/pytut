        <h1>Question 2</h1>
	<pre>
Only South African citizens who have registered in their municipality and are over the age of 18  may vote in the local elections.
A special round of voting runs before the main election for elderly citizens (75 years or older) and people with disabilities.
Write a program that takes a list indicating an individual’s age, whether they are registered, with 1 indicating being registered and 0
indicating not registered, and whether they are disabled, with 1 indicating being disabled and 0 indicating not disabled. The program
then outputs whether they can vote and which round of votes they will vote in (regular or general).

Note that output should take the form “can vote” or “cannot vote” and “special election” or “regular election”

Input format: [ age, registered, disability ]
For Example
18 0 0 = 18 years old, not registered, not disabled 	-> cannot vote

75 1 0 = 75 years old, registered, not disabled 		-> can vote
							           special election

60 1 1 = 65 years old, registered, has disability 		-> can vote
								   special election

35 1 0 = 35 years old, registered, not disabled 		-> can vote
							           regular election

The program is expected to take using input using 'raw_input' and to 'print' the output. The input should be space seperated.
